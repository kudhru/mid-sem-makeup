**Interviewer:** Professor Mehta, how have you integrated AI tools into your teaching?

**Rahul:** Honestly, I haven't used them much. I teach philosophy, and I believe critical thinking can't be taught by machines. Philosophy requires deep reflection and personal engagement with the material, which I don't think AI can facilitate. I'm concerned that AI might oversimplify complex ideas or encourage students to seek quick answers rather than engaging in thoughtful analysis. I prefer traditional teaching methods, like classroom discussions and written essays, where students can express their own interpretations.

**Interviewer:** Do you see any potential benefits of AI tools in education?

**Rahul:** Well, I suppose AI could assist with administrative tasks, like managing schedules or organizing resources. Maybe even providing quick references for students. But when it comes to the core of teaching philosophy, I remain skeptical. I also worry about ethical implications, like data privacy and the potential for AI to introduce biases into learning materials. There's also the concern that students might become too dependent on technology, hindering their ability to think independently.
