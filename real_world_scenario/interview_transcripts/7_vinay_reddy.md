**Interviewer:** Good afternoon, Prof. Reddy. Thank you for joining this interview. Could you start by telling me a bit about yourself and your teaching background?

**Prof. Reddy:** Good afternoon. I’m Vinay Reddy, an assistant professor of mathematics at a Tier-3 college. I’ve been teaching for about 12 years now, focusing mostly on calculus, linear algebra, and numerical methods. Teaching in a Tier-3 college has its own challenges, but I enjoy working with students and helping them build a strong foundation in mathematics.

**Interviewer:** That’s wonderful. Could you share your experience with AI tools? Have you used them in your teaching or other work?

**Prof. Reddy:** My experience with AI tools is quite limited. I’ve occasionally used ChatGPT to solve complex queries or to get ideas for how to explain certain mathematical concepts to my students. I’ve also experimented with tools for creating quizzes, but I haven’t been able to integrate AI into my teaching in a structured way. It’s something I’m interested in, but I just don’t have the time or resources to explore it properly.

**Interviewer:** That’s understandable. What is your general opinion about AI in education? Do you think it has potential?

**Prof. Reddy:** I do think AI has a lot of potential. It could make teaching and learning more efficient, especially in areas like grading or providing instant feedback to students. It could also help in personalizing education, catering to the needs of individual students. But at the same time, it’s not easy to implement these ideas, especially in colleges like ours where resources are limited.

**Interviewer:** That’s a fair point. What specific challenges do you face when it comes to adopting AI tools?

**Prof. Reddy:** One big challenge is time. My teaching load is quite heavy, and it doesn’t leave me much room to explore new tools or learn how to use them effectively. Another issue is institutional support. We don’t have access to the latest tools, and there’s no formal training provided for faculty. It’s up to individual professors to figure things out on their own, which can be overwhelming.

**Interviewer:** That does sound challenging. Do you think there are ways to address these issues and make AI more accessible to educators like yourself?

**Prof. Reddy:** Yes, definitely. First, colleges need to invest in workshops or training sessions to help faculty understand how AI tools work and how they can be applied to teaching. Second, there should be institutional support in terms of resources—like subscriptions to reliable AI tools or creating a centralized system where faculty can access them. Lastly, reducing the administrative burden on teachers would give us the time to explore these technologies.

**Interviewer:** Those are excellent suggestions. In your experience, how do students respond to the idea of using AI tools in their learning?

**Prof. Reddy:** Students seem quite open to it, especially the tech-savvy ones. They already use tools like ChatGPT for solving problems or preparing for exams. But I’ve noticed that not all students know how to use these tools responsibly. Some tend to misuse them, relying entirely on AI for answers without understanding the concepts. That’s something we need to address as educators.

**Interviewer:** That’s an interesting observation. Do you have any concerns about over-reliance on AI tools in education?

**Prof. Reddy:** Yes, that’s definitely a concern. Mathematics, in particular, is a subject where understanding the process is crucial. If students use AI to get answers without working through the steps, they miss out on developing problem-solving skills. I think it’s important to teach students how to use AI as a supplement to their learning, not as a substitute for effort.

**Interviewer:** That’s a thoughtful perspective. Do you think AI could help reduce your workload, particularly in areas like grading?

**Prof. Reddy:** It could, but only if the tools are reliable and easy to use. Grading takes up a lot of my time, especially in large classes. If AI could handle routine tasks like checking assignments or quizzes, it would free me up to focus on teaching and mentoring students. But I’d still want to review the AI’s output to ensure it’s accurate and fair.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Lastly, what excites you most about the future of AI in education?

**Prof. Reddy:** What excites me is the potential for AI to bridge gaps in education. In colleges like ours, where resources are limited, AI could make quality education more accessible. It could help us reach more students, provide personalized support, and even introduce new ways of teaching complex subjects. If we can overcome the challenges, I believe AI could transform education for the better.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Prof. Reddy, for sharing your experiences and insights. This has been a very informative discussion.

**Prof. Reddy:** Thank you. It’s been a pleasure to share my thoughts. I hope these conversations lead to positive changes in how we approach AI in education.
