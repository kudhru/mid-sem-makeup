**Interviewer:** Good morning, Dr. Gupta. Thank you for joining this interview. Could you start by telling me about your background and current role?

**Dr. Gupta:** Good morning. I’m Dr. Smita Gupta, an associate professor of sociology at a Tier-2 university. I’ve been teaching for over 25 years now, focusing on courses like social theory, cultural studies, and research methods. My work often involves guiding students through critical thinking and analysis, which I believe are fundamental to the discipline of sociology.

**Interviewer:** That’s wonderful. Could you share your experience with AI tools in education? Have you used them in your teaching?

**Dr. Gupta:** My experience with AI is fairly limited. I’m familiar with plagiarism checkers, which I’ve used to ensure originality in student submissions. Beyond that, I haven’t incorporated AI tools into my teaching. I’ve read about tools like ChatGPT and their applications, but I haven’t felt the need to rely on them extensively. To me, they seem more suited for technical disciplines.

**Interviewer:** That’s understandable. What is your general opinion about the role of AI in education?

**Dr. Gupta:** Frankly, I have mixed feelings. While I understand that AI can be helpful in certain contexts, I worry that it undermines critical thinking. For instance, if students rely on AI to generate essays or solve problems, they may miss the opportunity to engage deeply with the material. AI tools might encourage rote learning instead of fostering analytical skills, which are essential in a field like sociology.

**Interviewer:** That’s a valid concern. Do you see any ethical implications in using AI for educational purposes?

**Dr. Gupta:** Yes, there are significant ethical concerns. For one, how do we ensure that AI-generated work reflects a student’s own understanding? There’s also the issue of fairness—AI tools may introduce biases or errors that could unfairly impact student assessments. And let’s not forget data privacy. Many of these tools require personal or institutional data, and it’s unclear how securely that data is handled.

**Interviewer:** Those are important points. Are there specific scenarios where you think AI could be beneficial in education?

**Dr. Gupta:** AI might be useful for automating repetitive tasks like grading or generating study materials. For instance, in large classes, AI could help streamline administrative work, giving instructors more time to focus on teaching. But even in these cases, I’d want to review the AI’s output carefully to ensure accuracy and fairness. I’d also consider using AI to support students with language barriers, as it can simplify complex ideas for better understanding.

**Interviewer:** That’s an interesting perspective. Do you face any challenges in adapting to AI tools, either personally or institutionally?

**Dr. Gupta:** Personally, I find it challenging to trust AI tools completely. I come from a generation where learning is deeply personal and interactive, and I worry that AI takes away from that experience. Institutionally, there’s a lack of guidance on how to use these tools effectively. We don’t have clear policies or training sessions, so it’s hard to know where and how AI should fit into our work.

**Interviewer:** That’s a fair observation. How do you think these challenges could be addressed?

**Dr. Gupta:** I think we need clear policies on the ethical use of AI in education. Institutions should also offer training for faculty and students, so everyone understands both the capabilities and limitations of these tools. It’s important to strike a balance—AI should enhance education, not replace traditional methods. And we need to ensure that its use doesn’t compromise academic integrity.

**Interviewer:** That’s a thoughtful suggestion. Are there any risks you foresee if AI becomes more prevalent in education?

**Dr. Gupta:** One major risk is over-reliance. If students and instructors start depending too much on AI, it could lead to a loss of essential skills like critical thinking and creativity. There’s also the danger of dehumanizing education. Teaching and learning are fundamentally human processes—they involve empathy, context, and relationships. AI, no matter how advanced, can’t replicate that.

**Interviewer:** Those are valid concerns. Lastly, do you see any potential for AI in your field of sociology?

**Dr. Gupta:** Perhaps. AI could assist in analyzing large datasets for sociological research or identifying trends in qualitative data. But even then, the interpretation and context must come from a human. Sociology is about understanding society, culture, and human behavior—things that AI can’t fully grasp. It could serve as a tool, but the insights must always come from us.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Dr. Gupta, for sharing your experiences and perspectives. This has been a very insightful conversation.

**Dr. Gupta:** Thank you for having me. It’s been thought-provoking to reflect on these issues. I hope we can find a balanced way to integrate AI into education without losing sight of what truly matters.
