**Interviewer:** Good morning, Ramesh. Thank you for joining this interview. Could you start by telling me about your background and your role as a teaching assistant?

**Ramesh:** Good morning. My name is Ramesh Patil, and I’m a first-year master’s student specializing in computer science. As part of my program, I work as a teaching assistant for undergraduate programming courses. My responsibilities include grading assignments, solving student doubts, and sometimes even conducting lab sessions. It’s a great learning experience for me because I get to interact with students and help them understand programming concepts.

**Interviewer:** That sounds like a rewarding role. Could you tell me about your experience with AI tools in your work as a teaching assistant?

**Ramesh:** I’ve recently started using AI tools, and they’ve been very helpful. For example, I use tools like ChatGPT for grading assignments, especially coding submissions. It helps me evaluate the correctness of the code and even suggests improvements. I also use it to resolve student doubts quickly, especially when I need to explain concepts or debug code. It’s made my job a lot more efficient.

**Interviewer:** That’s great to hear. How do you feel these tools have impacted your work?

**Ramesh:** They’ve definitely made my work easier. Grading used to be very time-consuming, especially for large classes. AI tools reduce the workload by automating repetitive tasks, like checking for errors in code or comparing it against the rubric. This gives me more time to focus on helping students with their specific problems. It’s exciting to see how much time I can save with these tools.

**Interviewer:** That’s a positive perspective. Have you faced any challenges while using AI tools?

**Ramesh:** Yes, there are some challenges. One major issue is the reliability of AI-generated feedback. Sometimes, the feedback isn’t accurate or is too generic, especially for more complex assignments. I often have to double-check the AI’s suggestions to ensure they’re correct, which can take time. Another challenge is understanding how to prompt the AI properly to get the best results. It’s a bit of a learning curve.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. How do you handle these challenges in your day-to-day work?

**Ramesh:** I try to use AI tools as a starting point rather than a final solution. For grading, I review the AI’s feedback and make adjustments if needed. I also make sure to cross-check critical aspects of the assignment manually. As for learning how to use the tools better, I’ve been experimenting with different prompts and settings to improve the output. It’s a trial-and-error process, but I’m getting better at it.

**Interviewer:** That’s a good approach. Do you have any concerns about the use of AI in education, particularly in your role as a teaching assistant?

**Ramesh:** My main concern is about fairness. AI tools might not always understand the nuances of a student’s work, especially if the code is unconventional but still correct. There’s also the risk of students feeling disconnected if they think their work is being graded solely by a machine. I think it’s important to use AI as a support tool while ensuring that human judgment is still a part of the process.

**Interviewer:** That’s a thoughtful concern. How do students respond to the use of AI tools in their learning process?

**Ramesh:** Most students seem to like it, especially when AI tools are used to explain concepts or provide quick feedback. They appreciate the immediate responses and clarity that AI offers. However, some students are skeptical about whether the feedback is accurate or if the tools really understand their work. It’s a mix, but overall, I think they see it as a helpful addition.

**Interviewer:** That’s an interesting observation. Do you see any potential for AI to further enhance your work or the learning experience for students?

**Ramesh:** Absolutely. I think AI has a lot of potential to make education more personalized. For example, it could identify patterns in student submissions and suggest areas where the class as a whole needs more focus. It could also provide tailored learning resources for students based on their performance. I see AI as a tool that can bridge the gap between students and teachers, making the whole process more effective.

**Interviewer:** That’s an exciting vision. Lastly, what advice would you give to other teaching assistants who are new to using AI tools?

**Ramesh:** My advice would be to start small and experiment. Don’t rely completely on the AI—use it as a helper to save time and improve efficiency. Also, take the time to understand the limitations of the tools so you can make informed decisions about when and how to use them. Most importantly, keep the student experience at the center. AI is a tool, but the goal is always to help students learn better.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Ramesh, for sharing your experiences and insights. This has been a very enlightening conversation.

**Ramesh:** Thank you! I’m glad I could share my thoughts. AI in education is still new to me, but I’m excited to see where it goes.
