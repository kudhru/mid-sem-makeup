**Interviewer:** Hi Aarav, thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview. Let’s start with your background. Can you tell me a bit about yourself and your academic journey so far?

**Aarav:** Sure! I’m Aarav Mehta, a final-year computer science student at a Tier-1 engineering college here in India. I’ve always been fascinated by technology, especially AI and machine learning. Over the past couple of years, I’ve dived deep into using AI tools like ChatGPT, both for personal projects and academic work. It’s been a game-changer for how I approach learning.

**Interviewer:** That’s great to hear. Could you share how you specifically use AI tools like ChatGPT in your studies?

**Aarav:** Absolutely. I primarily use ChatGPT for three things: coding, research, and exam preparation. For coding, it helps a lot with debugging and generating snippets. Sometimes, I might be stuck on a problem for hours, but ChatGPT gives me a fresh perspective or solution within minutes. For research, I use it to summarize complex topics or brainstorm ideas for my assignments and projects. And during exams, it’s like a virtual tutor—I ask it questions, and it explains concepts in a way that’s easy to understand. It saves me so much time!

**Interviewer:** That sounds really efficient. Do you feel AI tools like ChatGPT have had an impact on your overall learning experience?

**Aarav:** Definitely. They make learning faster and more interactive. Instead of spending hours searching for resources, I can directly engage with the tool and get precise answers. This gives me more time to focus on understanding concepts deeply rather than getting bogged down in the basics. It also makes me feel more confident in tackling new topics because I know I have a reliable assistant at my disposal.

**Interviewer:** That’s a positive perspective. However, are there any challenges or concerns you’ve encountered while using these tools?

**Aarav:** Yes, there are a few. One major concern is over-reliance. Sometimes, it’s tempting to let ChatGPT do the heavy lifting, especially when I’m pressed for time. But I know that’s not ideal because it can make me lazy about thinking through problems myself. Another issue is ethical concerns, particularly plagiarism. It’s easy to use AI-generated content without fully understanding it, and that’s a slippery slope. I make a conscious effort to use it responsibly, but I can see how it might be misused.

**Interviewer:** That’s a valid point. How do you ensure that you use AI tools responsibly?

**Aarav:** I try to use AI as a guide rather than a crutch. For example, when I generate code snippets, I make sure to review and understand them before implementing them in my projects. Similarly, for assignments or essays, I use the tool to get ideas or drafts but always add my own inputs and citations. I also limit its use in exams unless explicitly allowed, as I feel that’s the ethical thing to do.

**Interviewer:** Have you noticed any gaps in how AI is integrated into your curriculum or by your instructors?

**Aarav:** Yes, there’s definitely a gap. Many of my professors are hesitant to fully embrace AI tools in the classroom. They’re either unaware of the potential benefits or worry that students might misuse them. I feel like if there were workshops or training sessions for both students and faculty, it would make a huge difference. AI has so much potential to make education more effective, but the adoption rate is slow.

**Interviewer:** That’s an interesting observation. What do you think could be done to better integrate AI into education?

**Aarav:** I think institutions need to create clear guidelines on how AI tools can be used ethically and effectively. Workshops, as I mentioned, would help a lot. Faculty training should also be a priority because many professors don’t fully understand how these tools work or how they can complement traditional teaching. AI can’t replace teachers, but it can definitely make their job easier by automating repetitive tasks like grading or providing personalized feedback.

**Interviewer:** Very insightful, Aarav. As we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to share about your experience with AI in education?

**Aarav:** Just that I think AI is the future of education. It’s not about replacing traditional methods but enhancing them. The key is to use it responsibly and ensure that it’s accessible to everyone. If used well, it can truly democratize learning and make it more engaging for students like me.

**Interviewer:** Thank you so much for your time and thoughts, Aarav. This has been a very enlightening conversation.

**Aarav:** Thank you! It was great talking to you.
