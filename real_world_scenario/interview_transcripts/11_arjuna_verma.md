**Interviewer:** Good morning, Arjun. Thank you for joining this interview. Could you start by telling me about your background and your role as a teaching assistant?

**Arjun:** Good morning. My name is Arjun Verma, and I’m currently a second-year master’s student specializing in data science. I’ve been working as a teaching assistant for undergraduate data science courses. My role involves grading coding assignments, helping students debug their projects, and occasionally leading lab sessions. It’s been a great learning experience, especially since I get to apply my knowledge in a practical setting.

**Interviewer:** That’s wonderful. Could you share your experience with AI tools in your work as a teaching assistant?

**Arjun:** Sure. I use AI tools extensively for grading and generating feedback for coding assignments. Tools like ChatGPT and specialized coding evaluators make it much easier to evaluate large volumes of submissions quickly. They help identify errors in code, suggest improvements, and even generate detailed feedback for students. This automation saves me a lot of time and allows me to focus on assisting students who need more help.

**Interviewer:** That sounds efficient. How do you feel these tools have impacted your workflow?

**Arjun:** They’ve definitely made my work more manageable, especially for repetitive tasks like checking syntax or logic in assignments. Earlier, grading used to take hours, but now I can complete it in a fraction of the time. The detailed feedback these tools generate is also a big plus—it’s consistent and often points out areas for improvement that I might miss during manual grading. Overall, it’s made my workflow faster and more organized.

**Interviewer:** That’s a positive perspective. Have you faced any challenges while using these tools?

**Arjun:** Yes, there are challenges. One of the biggest issues is fine-tuning the AI prompts. Student submissions can be very diverse, with different coding styles and approaches, and getting the AI to understand and evaluate them correctly isn’t always straightforward. Sometimes, the AI gives generic or even incorrect feedback, especially for edge cases. I often have to spend extra time refining prompts or manually reviewing the output to ensure accuracy.

**Interviewer:** That’s a fair concern. How do you handle such challenges in your day-to-day work?

**Arjun:** I use AI as an initial evaluator and then review the output myself. For example, I let the AI generate a preliminary evaluation, but I double-check the feedback for correctness and fairness before sharing it with students. Over time, I’ve learned to write better prompts and guide the AI more effectively, but it’s still a learning process. I also keep notes on common errors or issues, which helps me refine the grading process for future assignments.

**Interviewer:** That’s a thoughtful approach. Do you have any concerns about the fairness of AI-generated feedback?

**Arjun:** Definitely. Fairness is a big concern, especially when students use unconventional approaches that AI might misinterpret as incorrect. AI tools can sometimes be rigid in their evaluation, which isn’t ideal for coding assignments where there’s often more than one way to solve a problem. There’s also the risk of biases in the AI’s training data affecting the feedback. That’s why I make it a point to review all evaluations personally.

**Interviewer:** That’s an important point. How do students respond to the use of AI tools in their assignments?

**Arjun:** Most students seem to appreciate the detailed feedback and faster grading. It helps them understand their mistakes and improve. However, some students question the reliability of the feedback, especially when they feel it doesn’t fully consider their approach. I try to address their concerns by explaining how the AI works and reassuring them that I’ve reviewed the evaluations personally.

**Interviewer:** That’s a good practice. Do you see any potential for AI tools to further enhance your role or the learning experience for students?

**Arjun:** Absolutely. AI has the potential to make education more personalized. For example, it could analyze student submissions over time to identify patterns and provide tailored recommendations for improvement. It could also generate adaptive learning materials based on individual strengths and weaknesses. These tools could bridge the gap between students and instructors, especially in large classes where personalized attention is limited.

**Interviewer:** That’s an exciting vision. Lastly, what advice would you give to other teaching assistants who are new to using AI tools?

**Arjun:** My advice would be to start small and take the time to understand the tools. Don’t rely entirely on AI—use it as a support system to save time and enhance the quality of your work. Also, focus on writing clear prompts and reviewing the output carefully. And most importantly, keep an open line of communication with students. AI can speed up processes, but it’s the human element that makes teaching effective and meaningful.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Arjun, for sharing your experiences and insights. This has been a very enlightening conversation.

**Arjun:** Thank you! I’m glad I could share my perspective. AI in education is an exciting area, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it evolves.
