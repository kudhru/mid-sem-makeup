**Interviewer:** Hi Ali, thank you for joining this interview. Could you start by telling me a bit about yourself and your academic background?

**Ali:** Sure. My name is Ali Khan, and I’m a second-year student pursuing a diploma in business management at a Tier-3 college. I come from a small town, and I’ve always worked hard to keep up with my studies. English is not my first language, so I’ve often struggled with writing and grammar, but I’m doing my best to improve.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me about your experience with AI tools? Have you used them in your studies?

**Ali:** Yes, I’ve started using some AI tools recently, like ChatGPT and Grammarly. They’ve been really helpful for me, especially with grammar corrections and improving my essay writing. Sometimes I use them to understand difficult topics too. Since I don’t always have access to good resources or tutors, these tools feel like a lifesaver.

**Interviewer:** That’s great to hear. How do you feel AI tools have impacted your learning experience so far?

**Ali:** For me, AI tools are like an extra support system. They help me understand things that I find confusing, especially when I’m studying in English. For example, if I don’t understand a concept in my business textbooks, I can ask ChatGPT to explain it in simpler terms. It’s also really good at fixing my grammar, which gives me more confidence when submitting assignments.

**Interviewer:** That’s a positive perspective. Have you faced any challenges while using these tools?

**Ali:** Yes, there are a few challenges. One big problem is that I can’t afford premium versions of most tools. The free versions are good but sometimes give inconsistent or incomplete answers. For example, ChatGPT doesn’t always provide the full explanation I need, and I can’t afford to upgrade. Also, some tools don’t work well with my local internet connection, which can be frustrating.

**Interviewer:** That does sound difficult. How do you manage these limitations?

**Ali:** I try to make the most of what’s available for free. If the AI doesn’t give me a clear answer, I’ll break my question into smaller parts and ask again. Sometimes, I also look for other free resources online, like YouTube videos or blog posts. It takes more time, but I’ve learned to be patient and resourceful.

**Interviewer:** That’s a great strategy. How do you feel AI tools address the language barrier you mentioned earlier?

**Ali:** They help a lot! For someone like me, who isn’t fluent in English, AI tools are a huge advantage. They explain things in simple language and correct my mistakes without making me feel judged. I feel like I’m learning and improving every time I use them. But again, I wish the free versions were more reliable.

**Interviewer:** Do you think AI tools could be better integrated into your curriculum or teaching methods at your college?

**Ali:** Yes, I think so. In my college, most teachers don’t talk about AI tools, and some of them don’t even know they exist. If colleges could train students and teachers to use AI tools effectively, it would help people like me a lot. It would also make learning more fun and interactive. Right now, I’m figuring things out on my own, and it feels like AI is something we’re expected to know but not taught.

**Interviewer:** That’s an important point. In your opinion, what could be done to make AI tools more accessible to students like you?

**Ali:** First, there should be more free or affordable options for students. Not everyone can pay for premium versions, especially in Tier-3 colleges. Second, colleges should offer workshops or classes on how to use AI tools. If students and teachers knew how to use them properly, it would benefit everyone. And maybe there could be offline versions for people with poor internet.

**Interviewer:** Those are great suggestions. Lastly, do you have any concerns about using AI tools in education?

**Ali:** My main concern is that students might misuse them. For example, some people might copy everything the AI says without understanding it. That’s not learning—it’s just cheating. I think it’s important to use AI as a helper, not a replacement for effort. If we use it the right way, it’s a great tool.

**Interviewer:** That’s a thoughtful perspective. Thank you, Ali, for sharing your experiences and ideas. This has been a very insightful discussion.

**Ali:** Thank you for having me. I’m glad I could share my story.
