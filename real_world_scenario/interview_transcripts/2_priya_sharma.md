**Interviewer:** Hi Priya, thank you for taking the time to join this interview. Could you start by telling me a little about yourself and your academic journey?

**Priya:** Of course. My name is Priya Sharma, and I’m a final-year student pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in English literature at a Tier-2 university. I’ve always been passionate about reading and writing, and I enjoy the traditional classroom setting, where discussions and personal interactions play a key role in learning. I mostly rely on handwritten notes and physical textbooks for my studies.

**Interviewer:** That’s wonderful. How familiar are you with AI tools, and have you used any in your studies?

**Priya:** I’ve heard a lot about tools like ChatGPT, but my personal experience with them is quite limited. I tried using ChatGPT once for an essay topic, but I found it confusing and not very intuitive. I prefer relying on books and discussions with my professors. For me, writing and researching manually helps me connect better with the material.

**Interviewer:** That’s interesting. What is your general opinion about AI tools in education?

**Priya:** To be honest, I’m a bit skeptical. While I can see how AI might save time or provide quick answers, I worry that it takes away the need for critical thinking. For example, when writing an essay, the process of researching and drafting teaches you so much. If AI just gives you ready-made answers, where’s the learning in that? It also concerns me that students might lose their originality if they rely too much on AI for assignments.

**Interviewer:** That’s a valid perspective. Do you think AI tools can complement traditional learning methods, or do you see them as a replacement?

**Priya:** I think they can complement traditional methods if used carefully. For instance, AI could be helpful in generating quick summaries or finding references, but the actual learning and writing process should still be done by the student. I’d hate to see a time when students completely depend on AI for everything—it feels like it would take the soul out of education.

**Interviewer:** You mentioned you found AI tools confusing. Could you elaborate on the challenges you faced when trying to use them?

**Priya:** Yes, I remember trying to use ChatGPT once, and I struggled with how to phrase my questions. It wasn’t clear what kind of input the tool needed, and the responses felt generic. The interface itself wasn’t very user-friendly for someone like me who’s not tech-savvy. It made me feel like these tools are designed more for people who already understand them, not for beginners.

**Interviewer:** That’s a fair concern. Do you think there’s anything that could make these tools more accessible for students like you?

**Priya:** Definitely. First, there should be better guidance on how to use these tools effectively. Maybe tutorials or workshops could help. Also, the interface should be simpler and more intuitive—something that feels like a conversation, not a technical task. And it would be great if AI tools could explain their answers better, so students understand how the output was generated.

**Interviewer:** That’s a great suggestion. How do you see AI impacting the creativity and originality of students in the long run?

**Priya:** That’s one of my biggest concerns. Writing, for example, is deeply personal—it reflects your thoughts, experiences, and style. If students rely on AI to write essays or solve problems, they might lose their unique voice. Even in art or literature, originality is what makes work stand out. AI might provide shortcuts, but it can never replicate the thought process behind original ideas.

**Interviewer:** That’s an insightful observation. Do you see any positives in using AI tools in education?

**Priya:** Well, I can see how they could be helpful for students who struggle with access to resources or need quick guidance. AI could also make education more inclusive by breaking language barriers or simplifying complex topics. But I believe it’s important to strike a balance and not let AI overshadow the personal effort and growth that comes from traditional methods.

**Interviewer:** As we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts about the role of AI in education?

**Priya:** I think AI has potential, but it needs to be used responsibly. Education isn’t just about finding answers—it’s about learning how to think, analyze, and create. If AI can support that process without replacing it, then it might have a place in education. But for now, I still prefer the traditional way of learning—it feels more meaningful to me.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Priya, for sharing your perspective. This has been a very thoughtful discussion.

**Priya:** Thank you for having me. It was nice to reflect on these topics.
