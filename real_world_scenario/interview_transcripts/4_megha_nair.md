**Interviewer:** Hi Megha, thank you for joining this interview. Could you start by telling me a bit about yourself and your academic background?

**Megha:** Sure! My name is Megha Nair, and I’m a third-year engineering student specializing in artificial intelligence. I’ve always been fascinated by AI, and my course is giving me a chance to explore it in depth. I participate in a lot of hackathons and use AI tools extensively in my projects and assignments. It’s exciting to work in a field that’s constantly evolving and shaping the future.

**Interviewer:** That sounds amazing. Can you share how you use AI tools in your studies and projects?

**Megha:** Definitely. I use AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Hugging Face libraries for almost everything—coding, debugging, generating ideas, and even creating datasets for machine learning projects. In hackathons, AI tools help me prototype faster, which is critical when you’re working under tight deadlines. For assignments, I use them to explore complex topics or verify my understanding. These tools have become an integral part of my workflow.

**Interviewer:** That’s impressive. How do you feel AI tools have impacted your learning experience?

**Megha:** AI tools have completely changed how I learn. They’ve made the process faster and more interactive. For instance, if I’m stuck on a coding problem, ChatGPT can explain the issue and suggest solutions almost instantly. This saves me hours of searching through documentation or forums. They also give me the confidence to tackle challenging problems because I know I have support whenever I need it. I honestly feel they’ve made me a better and more efficient learner.

**Interviewer:** That’s a positive take. Do you think AI should be more integrated into the curriculum at your college?

**Megha:** Absolutely. AI is the future, and if we don’t start integrating it into education now, we’ll be left behind. It’s not just about learning how to use AI tools but also understanding their potential and limitations. For example, incorporating AI tools into coursework could help students focus on creative problem-solving rather than repetitive tasks. I believe every engineering curriculum should have a dedicated course on using AI tools effectively.

**Interviewer:** That’s an interesting point. Have you noticed any challenges or gaps in how AI is currently used in your classes?

**Megha:** Yes, there are a few. The biggest issue is the gap in faculty knowledge. While some professors are open to using AI, many don’t fully understand how these tools work or how they can enhance teaching. This limits how much AI gets integrated into our classes. I often feel like students are ahead of the faculty in terms of AI adoption, which is a missed opportunity. Professors need more training to use these tools effectively.

**Interviewer:** That’s a valid concern. How do you think this gap could be addressed?

**Megha:** I think colleges should invest in faculty training programs to familiarize professors with AI tools and their applications. Workshops, certifications, or even collaborative projects with students could help bridge the gap. It’s also important for institutions to create a culture where both students and faculty feel comfortable experimenting with AI. Without that, adoption will remain slow.

**Interviewer:** Those are great suggestions. Are there any challenges you face personally while using AI tools?

**Megha:** The main challenge for me is reliability. While AI tools are powerful, they’re not perfect. Sometimes, the solutions they suggest are incorrect or too generic, especially for more advanced problems. This means I always have to double-check their output, which can be time-consuming. Another issue is the lack of resources or support for integrating AI tools into large, collaborative projects. Most tools are built for individual use, which makes scaling difficult.

**Interviewer:** That’s insightful. Do you have any concerns about the long-term impact of AI tools on education?

**Megha:** My only concern is over-reliance. If students use AI tools without understanding the concepts behind them, it can lead to a lack of depth in learning. For example, generating code is easy, but if you don’t understand why it works, you won’t be able to debug or improve it. I think it’s important to use AI tools as assistants, not as replacements for critical thinking.

**Interviewer:** That’s a thoughtful perspective. Lastly, what excites you most about the role of AI in education?

**Megha:** What excites me is the potential for personalization. AI can adapt to the learning pace and style of each student, something traditional methods can’t do. It could make education more inclusive and accessible. I also feel that using AI tools prepares us for the future because these technologies are going to be part of almost every industry. If used wisely, AI can truly revolutionize education.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Megha, for sharing your experiences and insights. This has been a very enlightening discussion.

**Megha:** Thank you! I’m glad I could contribute. It’s always great to talk about something I’m passionate about.
