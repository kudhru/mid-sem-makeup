**Interviewer:** Good afternoon, Nidhi. Thank you for joining this interview. Could you start by telling me a bit about your background and your role as a teaching assistant?

**Nidhi:** Good afternoon. My name is Nidhi Jain, and I’m a first-year PhD scholar specializing in artificial intelligence. Alongside my research, I work as a teaching assistant for undergraduate AI and machine learning courses. My role involves mentoring students, grading assignments, and helping instructors integrate AI tools into their teaching workflows. Since I have experience in customizing AI tools, I often find myself troubleshooting issues or training others on how to use them effectively.

**Interviewer:** That’s impressive. Could you share how you use AI tools in your work as a teaching assistant?

**Nidhi:** Certainly. I use AI tools for a range of tasks. For example, I customize grading tools to evaluate assignments more efficiently and provide detailed feedback. I also use AI for creating adaptive quizzes and generating personalized study materials for students. These tools are particularly helpful in large classes where personalized mentoring isn’t always feasible. Additionally, I assist instructors by setting up AI-based analytics tools to track student progress and identify areas where they might need extra help.

**Interviewer:** That’s a fascinating use of AI. How do you feel these tools have impacted your work and the learning experience for students?

**Nidhi:** AI tools have been transformative. They’ve made repetitive tasks like grading much faster, allowing me to focus more on mentoring students. For students, the detailed feedback generated by AI helps them identify specific areas for improvement. I’ve also seen how adaptive quizzes and personalized content make learning more engaging and effective. Overall, I think AI has enhanced both the efficiency and the quality of education.

**Interviewer:** That’s a positive perspective. Have you faced any challenges while using or implementing AI tools?

**Nidhi:** Definitely. One of the biggest challenges is training my peers—other teaching assistants and instructors—on how to use these tools effectively. Many of them are hesitant to adopt AI, either because they find it too complex or because they’re skeptical about its reliability. I often end up spending a lot of time conducting workshops or one-on-one training sessions. Another challenge is ensuring that the AI tools are accurate and fair, especially for diverse student submissions. Customizing tools to handle edge cases can be tricky.

**Interviewer:** That sounds demanding. How do you handle these challenges, especially when it comes to training others?

**Nidhi:** I try to make the training sessions as hands-on and practical as possible. For instance, I walk my peers through real-life scenarios where AI tools can save time or improve outcomes. I also focus on demystifying the technology, showing them how to write effective prompts or troubleshoot common issues. Patience is key because everyone learns at their own pace. To ensure long-term adoption, I create simple guides and workflows that they can refer to later.

**Interviewer:** That’s a thoughtful approach. Do you think there’s a need for more institutional support to promote the adoption of AI tools?

**Nidhi:** Absolutely. Institutions need to invest in structured training programs for both students and faculty. They should also provide access to reliable AI tools and support customization for specific use cases. Right now, a lot of the burden falls on individual instructors or teaching assistants like me. With proper institutional backing, the adoption process would be much smoother and more impactful.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Do you have any concerns about the increasing reliance on AI in education?

**Nidhi:** Yes, there are a few concerns. One is over-reliance. While AI can handle routine tasks well, it’s not a substitute for critical thinking or personal mentorship. Students and educators need to remember that AI is a tool, not a teacher. Another concern is bias—AI tools are only as good as the data they’re trained on, and if that data is biased, it can lead to unfair outcomes. Finally, there’s the challenge of data privacy, especially when using AI tools that require access to student information.

**Interviewer:** Those are important points. How do students respond to the use of AI tools in their learning experience?

**Nidhi:** Most students appreciate the efficiency and personalized feedback that AI tools offer. They like getting instant insights into their work and find adaptive quizzes particularly helpful. However, some students are skeptical about whether the AI fully understands their submissions, especially for creative or unconventional solutions. I encourage them to view AI as a support system and to engage with the feedback critically.

**Interviewer:** That’s a good approach. Lastly, what excites you most about the future of AI in education?

**Nidhi:** What excites me is the potential for AI to truly democratize education. AI tools can make quality learning resources accessible to students in remote or underserved areas. They can also help educators identify and address learning gaps more effectively. I’m particularly interested in using AI to create collaborative and interactive learning experiences. The possibilities are endless, and I’m thrilled to be part of this journey.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Nidhi, for sharing your experiences and insights. This has been a very enlightening conversation.

**Nidhi:** Thank you! It’s been a pleasure to discuss these topics. I’m passionate about the role of AI in education, and I’m glad to contribute to the conversation.
