**Interviewer:** Good morning, Dr. Kumar. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. Could you start by telling me about your background and current role?

**Dr. Kumar:** Good morning! It’s a pleasure to be here. I’m Dr. Rajesh Kumar, a professor of computer science at a Tier-1 engineering college. I’ve been in academia for over 20 years, focusing primarily on software systems and artificial intelligence. Over the past few years, I’ve integrated AI tools into my teaching and administrative tasks, and it has completely transformed how I engage with my students.

**Interviewer:** That’s fascinating. Could you elaborate on how you use AI tools in your work?

**Dr. Kumar:** Absolutely. I use AI tools in several ways. For instance, I rely on them for grading assignments, especially in coding courses. Instead of manually reviewing hundreds of submissions, I use AI to evaluate the structure, syntax, and functionality of student code. I also use tools like ChatGPT to generate assignment questions or provide personalized feedback to students. These tools help me save time and focus on more strategic aspects of teaching, like curriculum design or mentoring research projects.

**Interviewer:** That’s impressive. How do you feel AI is impacting education, particularly in your field?

**Dr. Kumar:** I believe AI is revolutionizing education. It allows us to personalize learning at a scale that was previously impossible. For example, students in my classes come from diverse backgrounds and have varying levels of understanding. AI tools help me provide tailored feedback, ensuring that each student gets the support they need. It’s also enabling adaptive learning environments, where students can progress at their own pace, guided by intelligent systems.

**Interviewer:** That’s an inspiring perspective. Have you encountered any challenges while using AI tools in your teaching?

**Dr. Kumar:** Yes, there are a few. One major challenge is resistance from colleagues. Many of them are hesitant to adopt AI tools, either because they’re unfamiliar with the technology or skeptical about its benefits. Some worry that AI might replace the human touch in teaching. Another challenge is the lack of institutional support for large-scale integration of AI. While I’ve been proactive in adopting these tools, I often find myself working in isolation, without a cohesive strategy across departments.

**Interviewer:** That’s an important observation. How do you think these challenges could be addressed?

**Dr. Kumar:** The first step is awareness. Institutions need to invest in workshops and training sessions to demonstrate the potential of AI in education. Faculty members need to see these tools as assistants, not replacements. Collaboration is another key aspect. If departments work together to integrate AI into the curriculum, it becomes easier to adopt. Lastly, there needs to be a clear ethical framework to guide the use of AI, addressing concerns like bias or over-reliance.

**Interviewer:** Those are excellent suggestions. Do you think there are specific areas where AI integration could be particularly impactful?

**Dr. Kumar:** Absolutely. AI can be transformative in areas like assessment and evaluation. Grading assignments, generating rubrics, and providing feedback can be time-consuming, and AI can streamline these tasks. Another area is accessibility. AI can help bridge gaps for students with disabilities or language barriers by offering customized learning materials. Finally, in research, AI tools can assist in literature reviews, data analysis, and even hypothesis generation, making the process more efficient.

**Interviewer:** That’s very insightful. Have you observed any resistance or challenges from students in adopting AI tools?

**Dr. Kumar:** Students are generally more open to using AI, especially in technical fields like computer science. However, there’s a learning curve for those who aren’t tech-savvy or are from non-technical disciplines. Some students also tend to misuse AI, like copying answers without understanding the concepts. This is why I emphasize the responsible use of AI in my classes. It’s a tool, not a substitute for learning.

**Interviewer:** That’s an important point. Do you have concerns about over-reliance on AI in education?

**Dr. Kumar:** Yes, that’s a valid concern. If students rely too much on AI for answers, they might miss out on developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This is why I advocate for a balanced approach—using AI for support while ensuring that core learning remains intact. Educators have a responsibility to teach students how to use these tools ethically and effectively.

**Interviewer:** That’s a thoughtful perspective. Lastly, what excites you most about the future of AI in education?

**Dr. Kumar:** What excites me is the potential to democratize education. AI can make quality education accessible to students in remote or underprivileged areas, breaking down geographical and economic barriers. It can also empower educators by automating routine tasks, allowing them to focus on inspiring and mentoring students. If used wisely, AI can truly transform the education system for the better.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Dr. Kumar, for sharing your experiences and insights. This has been a very enlightening conversation.

**Dr. Kumar:** Thank you! I’m glad to contribute. AI in education is a topic I’m deeply passionate about, and it’s great to see it gaining attention.
