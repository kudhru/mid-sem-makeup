A recurring concern is the potential over-reliance on AI, leading to diminished critical thinking skills. Sunita Yadav warns, "While AI can handle routine tasks well, it’s not a substitute for critical thinking or personal mentorship." Dr. Smita Gupta echoes this sentiment: "I worry that it undermines critical thinking... If students rely on AI to generate essays or solve problems, they may miss the opportunity to engage deeply with the material."

**Bias and Fairness in AI Tools**

The accuracy and fairness of AI tools are also questioned. Arjun Verma notes, "AI tools can sometimes be rigid in their evaluation... There’s also the risk of biases in the AI’s training data affecting the feedback." Ensuring that AI tools handle diverse student submissions fairly remains a challenge.

**Lack of Institutional Support and Training**

Several participants highlight the need for institutional support and training. Nidhi Jain mentions, "One of the biggest challenges is training my peers... Many of them are hesitant to adopt AI." Prof. Vinay Reddy points out, "We don’t have access to the latest tools, and there’s no formal training provided for faculty."

**Digital Divide and Access Issues**

Access to AI tools is not uniform across all student populations. Dr. Menon acknowledges, "The biggest one is the digital divide... This creates inequality in how they benefit from AI-powered learning." Ali Khan, a student from a Tier-3 college, shares his struggles: "I can’t afford premium versions of most tools... Some tools don’t work well with my local internet connection."

**Data Privacy and Ethical Concerns**

Data privacy and ethical use of AI tools are significant concerns. Nidhi Jain raises the issue of data privacy: "There’s the challenge of data privacy, especially when using AI tools that require access to student information." Dr. Gupta questions the ethical implications: "How do we ensure that AI-generated work reflects a student’s own understanding?"

### Training and Support

**Need for Training Programs**

The necessity for structured training programs is emphasized by many participants. Nidhi Jain suggests, "Institutions need to invest in structured training programs for both students and faculty." Ramesh Patil advises other teaching assistants to "take the time to understand the tools... Also, focus on writing clear prompts and reviewing the output carefully."

**Faculty Resistance and Knowledge Gaps**

Faculty resistance due to unfamiliarity with AI tools hinders adoption. Dr. Menon observes, "Some instructors are hesitant to embrace AI, either because they find it intimidating or because they don’t fully trust it." Megha Nair notes, "Many of my professors are hesitant to fully embrace AI tools in the classroom... Professors need more training to use these tools effectively."

### Student Reactions

**Positive Reception and Appreciation**

Students generally appreciate the benefits of AI tools. Nidhi Jain remarks, "Most students appreciate the efficiency and personalized feedback that AI tools offer." Ramesh Patil adds, "Most students seem to like it, especially when AI tools are used to explain concepts or provide quick feedback."

**Skepticism and Concerns**

However, some students express skepticism about AI's ability to understand unique approaches. Arjun Verma mentions, "Some students question the reliability of the feedback, especially when they feel it doesn’t fully consider their approach."
